    "text": "My name is Timothy Faust and I write about healthcare. I am alternately fascinated and infuriated by the policy, practice, and infrastructure of American healthcare; how it fucks people over, and how America makes it difficult-to-impossible to live safely and freely in oneâ€™s body. I live in Milwaukee with my wife and my dog, and I like black metal, short fiction, the Milwaukee Bucks, riding my bike, the Green Bay Packers, coffee with a whisper of Jameson, Japanese neo-noir, and designing tasteful, functional spreadsheets.
