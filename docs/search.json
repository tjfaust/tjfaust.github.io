    "text": "My name is Timothy Faust and I write about healthcare. I am alternately fascinated and infuriated by the policy, practice, and infrastructure of American healthcare; how it fucks people over, and how America makes it difficult-to-impossible to life safely and freely in oneâ€™s body. I live in Milwaukee with my girlfriend and my dog, and I like the Milwaukee Bucks, the Green Bay Packers, black metal, riding my bike, coffee with a whisper of Jameson, short fiction, and Japanese neo-noir.
