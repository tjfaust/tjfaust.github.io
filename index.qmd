### Welcome To My Web Site!!

*My name is Timothy Faust and I write about healthcare. I am alternately fascinated and infuriated by the policy, practice, and infrastructure of American healthcare; how it fucks people over, and how America makes it difficult-to-impossible to life safely and freely in one's body. I live in Milwaukee with my girlfriend and my dog, and I like the Milwaukee Bucks, the Green Bay Packers, riding my bike, coffee with a whisper of Jameson, short fiction, and Japanese neo-noir. Wow!*

### WRITING
#### Recent work

* ***[Health Justice Now](https://www.healthjusticenow.com/)***, Melville House, 2019 
	+ *Health Justice Now* is a book I wrote as a primer for any interested layperson about "what is American healthcare, how does it work, and why do I feel fucked over all the time?" as well as an argument for single-payer health care. The book also explores broader concepts in health justice; the social and structural determinants of health, how they shake out in all kinds of people's lives, and the massive popular movement we need if we are ever to be free in our bodies. 
	+ "*The best concise explanation of why the United States needs single-payer health care — and needs to widen the definition of health care itself.*" — [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/14/why-we-need-single-payer-health-care-health-justice/)
	+ This is also, as far as I can tell, the only health policy book which references both Trent Reznor's *Pretty Hate Machine* and Wrestlemania XX.

* “[In American Indie Wrestling, Bodies Are Cheap And Healthcare is Not.](https://defector.com/in-american-indie-wrestling-bodies-are-cheap-and-healthcare-is-not)” Defector, 2023
	+ A longform piece about independent wrestlers, healthcare, and hustling. The work breaks down the body; every step is a bet with fate; and once you get the shit kicked out of you America makes it really, really hard to get better. “The blood may be fake, but the bleeding’s not.” - Dean Young

#### Medicare for All
Between 2017--2020, I traveled around the country in my shitty 2002 Honda CRV learning about healthcare in different parts of the country and talking to whomever I could find---church groups, political groups, schools; whomever. That work culminated in *Health Justice Now*, but I wrote some stuff on the way.

* “[He Doesn’t Have A Plan For That.](https://thebaffler.com/latest/he-doesnt-have-a-plan-for-that-faust)” *The Baffler*, 2020

#### Beyond healthcare
* “[You Too Can Donate A Kidney And Still Be A Normal Cool Guy Who Pounds Brewskis.](https://defector.com/you-too-can-donate-a-kidney-and-still-be-a-normal-cool-guy-who-pounds-brewskis)” Defector, 2023
	+ I donated my left kidney, Turkey, to my friend Laura and documented the process in the hope that other people might sign up to get tested.
* [*Palestine Speaks*](https://voiceofwitness.org/oral-history-book-series/palestine-speaks-voices-from-the-west-bank-and-gaza/). Voice of Witness, 2015
	+ I was an assistant on Palestine Speaks, a collection of interviews about daily life in occupied Palestine.

	+ One time I went on a date with a woman and she told me the story of how her ex had claimed he played “The Boys Are Back In Town” on repeat at a bar until he got kicked out and then proceeded to give me a blow-by-blow of my own story. Solidarity, brother.

* “Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer.” In 2016 me and my friend [Rory](https://www.twitter.com/BoneJail) made a t-shirt alleging ‘Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer,’ from a joke some of our internet friends made, and raised $70,000 for an abortion fund in Texas. Here’s some of the coverage.
